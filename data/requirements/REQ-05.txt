A general electricity meter can display the current consumption (integer) and fundamentally has an identification number. A general consumer has at most one electricity meter. Special consumers can be private or business customers, where private and business customers initially have the same properties as a general consumer. In contrast to private customers, however, business customers can receive a discount (floating point) on the electricity price (floating point). Traditional rotary meters as well as the newer smart meters, which will become mandatory from 2017, are used as electricity meters. Smart meters and rotary meters initially have the same properties as a general electricity meter. However, a smart meter can also determine the estimated electricity costs in addition to the electricity price, and can function as a server on the internet. Therefore, a smart meter fundamentally has an IP (e.g., 192.168.1.15) and a port in the range of 0 to 65535. Additionally, none, one, or any number of general extensions can be installed on a smart meter. A special extension is only available for business customers and adjusts the electricity costs displayed by the smart meter based on the business customer's discount.
